Severe Weather & Hurricane FAQs
In case of a hurricane or other severe weather, will Main Street Renewal assist me in preparing my home or provide any preparation materials such as boards and sandbags? We encourage you to take necessary steps to stay safe in the event of severe weather. Please review ready.gov‘s information and recommendations on preparing for and staying safe during severe weather situations. While we don’t have the ability to provide materials or labor to prepare your home for severe weather, the safety of our valued Residents is our primary concern, and we encourage you to take the steps necessary to stay safe.

Am I able to board my windows to prepare for an approaching hurricane? We encourage you to take all the necessary steps to be safe. You may board windows at your own discretion and cost but please be advised you will be responsible for taking them down and responsible for any damage that may occur during installation on the home.

Am I liable for any damage to the home if I do not board windows and doors? You will not be liable for storm damage to your home if you do not board your windows or install shutters and will not be responsible for damage caused by the storm. You are responsible for damage to any personal property, however.

What can I expect after the storm passes? Your safety is our number one concern. If you live in an affected area, our teams may reach out to you soon by phone to check-in and ensure you are safe. You can also let us know that you are safe by sending us a quick note to <residentcareteam@msrenewal.com> and include your home address in the email.
